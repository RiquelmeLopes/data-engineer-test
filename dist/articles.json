        "text": "Donald Trump enjoys a huge lead among men, while women tell pollsters they prefer Kamala Harris by a similarly large margin. The political gender gap reflects a decade of social upheaval and could help decide the US election. For the first woman of colour to secure a presidential nomination, and only the second woman to ever get this close, Kamala Harris goes to great lengths not to talk about her identity. “Listen, I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender,” the vice-president said in a CNN interview last month. And yet, despite all her efforts to neutralise the subject, gender is shaping up to be the defining issue of this campaign. “Madame President” would be a new thing for America and it’s reasonable to assume that while many voters love the idea, some find the novelty a little unnerving. The Harris campaign won’t say it publicly, but one official acknowledged to me recently that they do believe there is “hidden sexism” here that will deter some people from voting for any woman for president. It’s 2024 and few people want to be the jerk who’ll tell a pollster outright that they don’t think a woman is fit for the Oval Office (though plenty are prepared to share misogynistic memes on social media). A Democratic strategist suggested there’s a code, when voters tell pollsters that Harris is not “ready” or doesn't have the right “personality” or “what it takes,” what they really mean is that the problem is she’s a woman. The Trump campaign says gender has nothing to do with it. “Kamala is weak, dishonest, and dangerously liberal, and that’s why the American people will reject her on November 5th,” it said this week. Although Bryan Lanza, a senior adviser to the campaign, texted me to say he’s confident Trump will win because “the male gender gap gives us the edge”. Last time a woman ran for president, negative attitudes to her gender were clearly a factor. Eight years ago Hillary Clinton touted her being the first female nominee of a major party. The campaign’s slogan “I’m with Her” was a not very subtle reminder of her trailblazing role. Pennsylvania Congresswoman Madeleine Dean remembers discussing Clinton’s candidacy with voters. I spent an afternoon with Dean as she campaigned in her district this week and she told me that back in 2016 people would tell her, ‘There’s just something about her.’ She says she soon realised that “It was about the ‘her.’ That was a thing. It was that [Hillary] was a woman.” While Dean thinks that sentiment is less prevalent today, she acknowledges that even now, “there are certain people who just think ‘A powerful woman? No, a bridge too far.’” A lot has changed for women since 2016. The #MeToo movement in 2017 increased awareness of the subtle - and the not so subtle - discriminations women face at work. It changed the way we talk about women as professionals. MeToo may have made it easier for a candidate like Harris to secure the nomination. But those big steps forward on the issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion were interpreted by some as a step back, especially for young men who felt they’d been left behind. Or the changes were simply a step too far for conservative Americans who prefer more traditional gender roles. So for some voters, this November’s election has turned into a referendum on gender norms, and the social upheavals of recent years. This seems particularly true for the voters Kamala Harris has a tough time reaching: the young men who live in a world that is rapidly changing for, well, young men. “Young men often feel like if they ask questions they are labeled as misogynist, homophobic or racist,” says John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Institute of Politics. “Frustrated at not feeling understood, many then get sucked into a bro-culture of Donald Trump or Elon Musk. They look at who the Democrats prioritise - women, abortion rights, LGTBQ culture - and they ask ‘what about us?’” Della Volpe specialises in polling younger voters. He says the young men he is referring to are not part of some radical alt right, incel cabal. They are your sons, or they’re your neighbour’s sons. Indeed, he says, many support equality for women, but they also feel their own concerns go unheard. Della Volpe ticks through a list of statistics showing ways young men today are worse off than their female counterparts: they are less likely to be in relationships, they are less likely to enrol in college than they used to, they have higher rates of suicide than their female peers. Young American women meanwhile are steaming ahead. They are better educated than men, they work in service industries that are growing and increasingly they are earning more than men. In the period since Donald Trump was elected president, young women have also become significantly more liberal than young men, according to the Gallup polling group. Which is all creating a stark gender split. Over the last seven years, the share of young men who say the US has gone “too far” promoting gender equality has more than doubled, according to the American Enterprise Institute. With his almost intuitive grasp of people’s dissatisfactions, Trump has tapped into that male frustration, and in the final weeks of his campaign he has doubled down on masculinity. He reposted a warning on Truth Social claiming “Manhood is Under Attack.” Recently he joked about a famous golfer’s genitalia. “This is a guy that was all man,” said Trump, referring to golfer Arnold Palmer. “When he took showers with the other pros, they came out of there – they said, ‘Oh my God. That’s unbelievable.’” Trump took the locker room talk out of the locker room - and his audience loved it. Riffing about penis size at a political rally, it was the ultimate pushback against stifling political correctness. In their rallies, and on the airwaves, the Democrats’ response to disaffected men seems to be a dose of tough love. Barack Obama scolded that some men “aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.” In a new TV ad, Actor Ed O’Neill was a little snappier but more direct: “Be a man: Vote for a woman.” In the final days of this campaign, gender is everywhere - and nowhere. Donald Trump wants manhood front and centre of this race. Kamala Harris barely acknowledges she is a woman running for office. In a New York Times poll, Trump leads with male voters by 14%. Harris leads women by 12%. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls - they may well decide this election.",

        "headline": "Abercrombie & Fitch: How my investigation led to sex trafficking charges against ex-boss",
        "text": "In a federal courtroom in New York, for the first time I’m face to face with Mike Jeffries – the multi-millionaire ex-fashion boss I’ve spent three years investigating for the BBC. He stares at me directly, lips pursed, and chin raised, as he sits before the judge. As a result of my reporting, he wasarrested this week by the FBIand charged with running an international sex trafficking and prostitution business along with his British partner, Matthew Smith, and their middleman James Jacobson. Authorities acted after hearing my podcast series,The Abercrombie Guys, in which I unearthed evidence that Mr Jeffries, 80, and Mr Smith, 61,had been at the centre of a sophisticated global operation involving a network of recruitersand a middleman scouting young men for sex. As CEO of teen retailer Abercrombie & Fitch, Mike Jeffries was described to me as an eccentric and superstitious genius who, with his highlighted hair and penchant for flip-flops and plastic surgery, personified the youthful All-American brand he created. But now, his hair white, his fillers dissolved, and wearing an ankle monitor – he seemed a shadow of the mogul said to have used his power and strength while in charge to abuse vulnerable models. US prosecutors say he and the others accused used force, fraud and coercion to make men engage in violent and exploitative sex acts from at least 2008-2015. If convicted, they face a maximum of life in prison. Shoulders slouched, Mr Jeffries’ face was blank as his lawyer entered his plea of not guilty. His life partner Matthew Smith - a UK citizen - is yet to appear in court. He’s considered a flight risk by authorities and is currently detained until trial. Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual acts When I think back to how my own investigation began, in January 2021, I never imagined it would lead to this moment. During the pandemic, I was researching the fashion industry when I stumbled across a cryptic Instagram comment written by a former model named Barrett Pall. He was part of a group discussing how they felt abuse against male models was being ignored. “We’ve seen it happen with #MeToo, how about #UsToo?” one wrote. We soon got on the phone. After an hour of talking, he said he felt he could trust with me a secret he’d never really shared before. “It’s probably like the darkest experience I’ve ever dealt with,” he told me. “They had someone come and shave me, like my whole body, because that’s how they like the boys.” In 2011, then aged 22, Barrett said he’d been referred by an older model, who was a close friend, to meet a mysterious middleman he described as having a missing nose covered with a snakeskin patch. He said this man - who I later identified through phone and property records as James Jacobson - had made him perform a sex act as a “tryout” before sending him to Mike Jeffries, then CEO and chairman of Abercrombie & Fitch, and his British partner. Barrett claimed that, for years, the duo had been throwing elaborate sex events at their palatial home in the Hamptons. He said the one he had attended was facilitated by chaperones in Abercrombie polos and flip-flops, carrying silver platters of alcohol, poppers and lube. What Barrett told me sparked my initial two-year investigation. I travelled across America, from the suburbs of Ohio to the desert of Palm Springs, tracking down men affected and confronting those involved – including the middleman himself. Usually when I’m investigating, I can find a few loose threads to pull at by searching newspaper archives, court records or social media. But there was absolutely nothing in the public domain about these allegations. So I took an old-school approach, piecing together my own trail through word of mouth, knocking on doors, and sending handwritten letters to potential sources. I traced and contacted hundreds of people including former Abercrombie & Fitch models and Mr Jeffries’ ex-household staff, earning trust over months. Then, a massive breakthrough. Barrett Pall had an old iPad that wouldn’t turn on - but we got it fixed. Through that, I obtained an itinerary and flight ticket corroborating the event he attended in the Hamptons. It was sent by the middleman James Jacobson and contained some first names and numbers of others involved. I later recovered more than a dozen of these itineraries from different sources, finally giving me concrete leads. But it took me months to figure out their roles, not wanting to tip the wrong person off while I was still in evidence-gathering mode. Many men were wary of speaking. Two accused me of being a “spy” for Mike Jeffries – initially fearful of his “money and clout”. I, too, became increasingly paranoid after I began facing hundreds of hacking attempts each day from unknown IP addresses.  We were right to be cautious. In their indictment, unsealed on Tuesday, prosecutors said Mike Jeffries had employed a full-service security company to oversee non-disclosure agreements (NDA), conduct background checks, and surveil and intimidate anyone who threatened to expose them. I have since spoken with more than 20 men who attended or helped organise these events for Mr Jeffries and his partner Matthew Smith. Some like Luke, an aspiring model who told mehe was recruited under the guise of attending an A&F photoshoot, said they had been misled and not told sex was involved. How did this operation stay hidden for so long? The answer I reached was that the shame some men felt talking about same-sex abuse had silenced them as effectively as any NDA. Some told me they had felt suicidal, others completely broken. In many instances, I was the first person they had confided in. One man, who I’m calling Alex, broke down as he told me he believed he was drugged and raped by an unknown assailant at an opulent event hosted in Marrakesh for which dozens of men had been flown in. He believed this led to him contracting HIV. “Jeffries was the kingpin,” he told me at the time. “Without him none of this could have happened.” Ahead of publication, I worked withBBC Panoramato meticulously fact-check my evidence. This involved speaking with those inside the operation - including James Jacobson. When podcast producer Ruth Evans and I knocked on his door one sweltering day in rural Wisconsin in August 2023, he sank onto his steps, put his head in his hands and swore. He asked me for a deal. “Leave my name out and I’ll tell you everything,” he said. Mr Jacobson repeated this request dozens of times the following day, when he agreed to meet for coffee. We spoke for two hours. At times it was bizarre - he admired my shorthand, commented on my British accent and seemed to patronise me - calling me “sweetheart”. He’s a former actor and at one point put on a bunch of accents, and pretended to wear a cloak, trying to convince me he could do an anonymous interview. But he was charismatic too, and joked about his missing nose, saying the only job he could get these days was as a Bond villain. Eventually, Mr Jacobson said he was just “doing his job” and hadn’t spoken to Mr Jeffries or Mr Smith since 2015. Ultimately, he didn’t get his deal, and in court, he again sat with his head in his hands as his lawyer entered a plea of not guilty. After we published in October 2023, some of the men in this story took legal action against Mike Jeffries, Matthew Smith and Abercrombie & Fitch, who they are suing for rape, assault and sex trafficking.All deny wrongdoing.The lawsuit claims it’s likely that more than 100 men were abusedduring Mr Jeffries' tenure. Sources also began contacting me to say they had been approached by law enforcement. We were not involved in the FBI’s investigation - which was totally independent of mine. Protecting sources is integral to my work. So, it would be the men’s decision to talk. Looking back, there were moments I considered giving up. I initially faced dead end after dead end. But the more I heard, the more I felt a duty to bring this to light for the first time and hold those involved to account. More than two years on from our first conversation, I asked Barrett Pall why he decided to speak to me. He started crying and said: “My gut said trust her. Tell her your story. And maybe, just maybe, someone will listen.” Announcing the charges, US attorney Breon Peace said: “To anyone who thinks they can exploit and coerce others by using the so-called 'casting couch' system, this case should serve as a warning. Prepare to trade that couch for a bed in federal prison.”",

        "headline": "One dead, dozens injured after truck hits Israel bus stop",
        "text": "A man has died and at least 30 more have been injured after a truck hit a bus stop near an Israeli military base north of Tel Aviv, in what authorities are investigating as a suspected terror attack. \"A truck hit dozens of people who had disembarked at a bus stop. Eight of the wounded were trapped under the truck and others were lying and walking near it,” a medic for Israel's Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said. Many of the injured were reportedly pensioners on a day trip to a nearby museum. The driver of the truck, named as Rami Natur, an Arab Israeli from the town of Qalansawe in central Israel, was shot dead by a civilian at the scene. Emergency services were called to the Glilot Junction around 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT) on Sunday following reports of a truck ramming. Yechiel Ben Moshe told the Ynet website: \"We were a group of retirees going to Glilot to visit a museum and listen to a lecture.\" \"The bus parked, and people got off. A truck came from behind and I heard a huge noise from the truck. \"It drove toward us to run us over.\" \"Around me, everyone was injured and bleeding, and others were in shock. It looked like an accident at first, but then shots were fired at the terrorist.\" Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who is responsible for the police, called for the family of the suspected attacker to be deported from Israel. Israel is already fighting its enemies on multiple fronts in Gaza and Lebanon. But this attack raises a different question: how to keep its people safe from attackers already inside Israel, who use vehicles as weapons.",

        "headline": "Japan election: Ruling LDP to fall short of majority - exit poll",
        "text": "Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is set to fall short of a single-party majority after a close-run snap election, exit polls suggest. The LDP is projected to win from 153 to 219 lower house seats, broadcaster NHK said.  The Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP) is projected to win from 128 to 191 seats. A party needs 233 seats to control the house, known as the Diet, meaning the LDP will need to enter a coalition to stay in power. It was previously in coalition with the smaller Komeito party, though projections suggest their joint vote share may still fall short of a majority, prompting uncertainty about how the world's fourth-largest economy will be governed. The election was called by the LDP’s new leader Shigeru Ishiba three days after he was selected as new leader - before he had been officially sworn in as prime minister. It comes after a tumultuous few years for the LDP which saw a “cascade” of scandals, widespread voter apathy and record-low approval ratings. The party had seen approval ratings of below 20% earlier in the year, in the wake of a political fundraising corruption scandal. Yet opposition parties have failed to unite, or convince voters they are a viable option to govern. The main opposition party had an approval rating of just 6.6% before parliament was dissolved. “It is so hard to make decisions to choose parties, I think people are losing interest,” Miyuki Fujisaki, a long-time LDP supporter who works in the care-home sector, told the BBC ahead of polls opening. The LDP, she said, has its problems with alleged corruption, “but the opposition also does not stand out at all”. “They sure complain a lot, but it’s not at all clear on what they want to do,” the 66-year-old said. For all the apathy, politics in Japan has been moving at a fast pace in recent months. Shigeru Ishiba took over as prime minister after being voted in by the ruling party following his predecessor Fumio Kishida - who had been in the role since 2021 – making a surprise decision to step down in August. The move to call the election came at a time when the LDP is desperate to restore its tarnished image among the public. Ishiba - a long-time politician who previously served as defence minister - has described it as the “people’s verdict”. A series of scandals has tarnished the ruling party’s reputation. Chief among them is the party’s relationship with the controversial Unification Church - described by critics as a “cult” - and the level of influence it had on lawmakers. Then came the revelations of the political funding corruption scandal. Japan’s prosecutors have been investigating dozens of LDP lawmakers accused of pocketing proceeds from political fundraising events. Those allegations - running into the millions of dollars - led to the dissolution of powerful factions, the backbone of its internal party politics. “What a wretched state the ruling party is in,” said Michiko Hamada, who had travelled to Urawa station, on the outskirts of Tokyo, for an opposition campaign rally. “That is what I feel most. It is tax evasion and it’s unforgivable.”  It strikes her as particularly egregious at a time when people in Japan are struggling with high prices. Wages have not changed for three decades – dubbed “the lost 30 years” – but prices have risen at the fastest rate in nearly half a century in the last two years. This month saw more price hikes on thousands of food products, as well as other day-to-day provisions like mail, pharmaceuticals, electricity and gas. “I pay 10,000 yen or 20,000 yen ($65 - $130; £50 - £100) more for the food per month (than I used to),” Ms Hamada said. “And I’m not buying the things I used to buy. I am trying to save up but it still costs more. Things like fruit are very expensive.” She is not the only one concerned with high prices. Pensioner Chie Shimizu says she now must work part-time to make ends meet. “Our hourly wage has gone up a bit but it does not match the prices,” she told the BBC as she picked up some food from a stand at Urawa station. “I come to places like this to find something cheaper and good because everything in regular shops is expensive.”",

        "headline": "Singapore: A puff of marijuana - then locked up in compulsory drug rehab",
        "text": "Kim* is a young professional who started using cannabis when family life became messy. Things improved, but her drug habit stuck - and by then, her social circle was primarily made up of people who also used. With a reliable local supplier of weed, Kim’s friends asked her if she would get some for them. “That’s what I did,” Kim says. “I never marked up the price in any way, because this was friendship... It’s like, I’m helping you to purchase something we both use anyway.” Singapore, where Kim lives, has some of the harshest drugs laws in the world. If you sell, give, deliver, administer, transport or distribute narcotics, that’s drug trafficking. And the law also presumes you’re a trafficker if you possess drugs in quantities that cross certain weight thresholds. Kim’s life unravelled very fast when one of the friends she sourced cannabis for was caught by the state’s Central Narcotics Bureau. Kim was named as the supplier of the marijuana, and picked up too. After the authorities trawled through her phone, another friend was arrested - and Kim was charged with drug trafficking. “I was wracked with horror,” she says. “To have charges of trafficking levelled at me? That was just overwhelming. I felt complete and utter fear of what was going to pan out for me.” Cannabis for recreational use has been decriminalised in many places around the world. In the US, 24 states have legalised it. While cannabis is illegal In the UK,  punishments for its possession have plummeted in recent years. In Singapore, if you’re found with 15g you’re assumed to be trafficking - and with 500g or more, the death penalty is mandatory. It’s a controversial policy and there have beenseveral recent cases. The most recent execution - of a 64-year-old on a heroin charge - took place on 16 October. The Singaporean government won’t tell the BBC how many people are currently on death row. Singapore’s death penalty becomes mandatory in drug cases involving Kim’s not facing execution, but she could be looking at a lengthy prison term. “The minimum sentence would be five years,” she says. “The worst-case could be up to 20 years.” While Kim awaits judgement on trafficking charges, her friends have already been dealt with. But they weren’t prosecuted. Classed as drug consumers - not traffickers - they faced very different treatment. They were sent to the state-run Drug Rehabilitation Centre for six months each. When anyone’s caught using an illicit substance in Singapore, they’re assessed as low, medium or high risk. Only those deemed at low risk of reoffending are allowed to stay at home, where they are monitored in the community. Everyone else - even a first-time offender - is sent for compulsory rehabilitation. There’s no private, residential rehab in Singapore - no mooching around in fluffy bathrobes and then retreating to your own en-suite room. The Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) is a vast complex run by Singapore’s Prison Service, which makes sense because this is incarceration by any other name. There’s barbed wire, a control room, and CCTV everywhere. Guards patrol the walkways. In December 2023, 3,981 Singaporeans were inmates - about 1 in 8 of them women. Institution S1 houses around 500 identically-dressed male inmates, most first or second-time drug offenders. A cell accommodates seven or eight men. There are two toilets, and a shower behind a waist-high wall. There are no beds. The men sleep on thin, rush mats on the concrete floor. And a detainee will spend at least six months here - even if they’re a casual, rather than addicted, drug user. “While it is rehabilitation, it’s still a very deterrent regime,” says Supt Ravin Singh. “We don’t want to make your stay too comfortable.” The men spend up to six hours a day in a classroom on psychology-based courses. “The aim is to motivate inmates to want to stay away from drugs, to renew their lives without them, and to address negative thinking regarding drugs,” says Lau Kuan Mei, Deputy Director for the Correctional Rehabilitation Service. “They teach us a lot about how to manage our triggers for using drugs,” says Jon*, who’s in his late 20s and close to the end of a six-month stay. Jon has a history of using methamphetamine and is one of the inmates prison authorities have selected to talk to the BBC. Meth (also known as crystal or ice) is a powerful, highly addictive stimulant, and the most commonly abused drug in Singapore and the region. Earlier this year, on a weekday afternoon, Central Narcotics Bureau officers arrived at Jon's house where he lives with his parents. Before they took him away, he spoke to his shocked mother. “She said, ‘learn your lesson, pay your dues, and come back clean,” Jon remembers. And that’s what he’s aiming to do - but he knows it won’t be easy. “It’s exciting leaving,” he says. “But I’m also nervous... In here you’re locked up and not faced with drugs.” Jon’s worried he might be tempted to take meth again. His rehab programme has been obligatory, not voluntary as it might have been if he lived in North America or Europe. Even so, it might not impact his chances of staying drug-free. \"If you look at evidence-based policies in drug addiction... it doesn’t really matter whether the treatment offered is voluntary or non-voluntary,” says Dr Muni Winslow, an addiction psychiatrist who worked in Singapore’s government institutions. He believes the treatment offered to drug users has improved. “It’s much better now because the whole criminal justice system has a lot of psychologists and counsellors who are trained in addictions.” Historically, drugs have been viewed as a criminal justice issue, rather than a health issue in Singapore. While the state execution of traffickers still sets the tone for how the government and most Singaporeans view narcotics, it hasn’t prevented changes to how drug users are treated. For example, no-one who spends time in the rehab centre gets a criminal record. “We talked to psychologists and addiction specialists and our thinking evolved,” explains Minister for Home Affairs and Law, K Shanmugam. “If they’re not a threat to society, we don’t need to treat them as criminals.” Singapore commits huge resources to enabling people to stay clean once they leave the DRC. Most importantly, they’re helped to find work. But although authorities say the system has changed, critics believe it's still inhumane. The Transformative Justice Collective, a group which campaigns against the death penalty, describes the DRC as a form of mandatory detention where prisoners face \"humiliation\" and \"loss of liberties\". The group says programmes in the centre are superficial and focused on \"shame\" - failing to tackle the root causes of drug dependence. \"We've seen a lot of lives disrupted and a lot of trauma inflicted from being arrested, from being thrown into prison, from having to share a cell,\" says Kirsten Han. \"It causes a lot of stress and instability. And these are not harms caused by drugs. These are harms caused by the war on drugs.\" Surveillance remains a critical part of the country's mission to keep former inmates clean. At a supervision centre, a neat-looking man in his 50s arrives. He’s been in and out of the Drug Rehabilitation Centre six times, struggling with heroin. But for the last 26 months he’s been drug-free, living at home, monitored by an electronic tag. Now his sentence is over. When the tag’s snipped off, he’s delighted, and leaves quickly after exchanging a few words with Karen Lee, the director of the Community Corrections Command. “He looks healthy,” she says. “And that’s what we hope for all our supervisees… While three out of 10 do come back as repeat drug abusers, we shouldn’t forget there are seven supervisees out there, successfully living their lives as reintegrated citizens of Singapore.” While tagged, the ex-heroin user had another incentive to stay clean: regular urine analysis. Singapore’s state-of-the-art Urine Supervision Cubicles are the first of their kind in the world. Once a supervisee enters a cubicle, the door locks behind him. After he pees into the urinal the technology tests for drugs including cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy and heroin. It takes about seven minutes. “It’s not so boring - we’ve also prepared videos for him to watch, like Mr Bean!” says Karen Lee. If the test is negative, a green light goes on, and the man’s free to go. A red light indicates a positive test result - and the supervisee will be re-arrested. Singapore’s zero-tolerance policy doesn’t distinguish between casual drug users and those with an addiction. And although punishment is no longer front and centre of the system, Singapore retains draconian practices - including a legal requirement for doctors to report patients to the authorities if they disclose use of narcotics. This may well deter people from getting help with problematic drug dependency. But the harshest treatment is reserved for those convicted of trafficking. Kim - who sourced cannabis for her friends - is trying to keep busy while she waits for the court’s decision about the charges against her. “Once I heard there was very little possibility of me not serving a sentence, I took some time,” Kim says, “to mourn almost, for the period of my life I would lose. I think I've accepted prison on a deeper level. It just never gets easier as the day draws nearer.” If Kim’s incarcerated - as she expects - she won’t be unusual. In December 2023, around half of the country’s convicted prison population - 2,299 people - were serving time for drug offences. * All names have been changed. If you, or someone you know, have been affected by addiction, there are details oforganisations who may be able to help at BBC Action Line. Singapore: Drugs, rehab, execution The laws against illegal narcotics are notoriously severe in Singapore. Penalties for trafficking include the death penalty, but the government argues its zero-tolerance policy is effective. If you are caught using any illicit narcotic, including cannabis, you may find yourself in compulsory rehab. The BBC's Linda Pressly approached Singapore's authorities and was granted access to the state’s austere Drug Rehabilitation Centre. She speaks to drug users who have to spend months at the facility before being released back into the community under surveillance.",

        "headline": "Georgian election: Pro-EU opposition says vote stolen as ruling party claims victory",
        "text": "Pro-Western opposition groups in Georgia have refused to accept results that hand victory to the increasingly authoritarian ruling party, after a pivotal election focused on the country's future path in Europe. The Georgian Dream party of billionaire businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili claimed outright victory and the central election commission said it had won 54% of the vote based on more than 99% districts counted. The initial results were dramatically different from exit polls conducted by Western pollsters. Tina Bokuchava of the opposition United National Movement said the elections had been falsified and the vote \"stolen from the Georgian people\". Another opposition leader, Nika Gvaramia, said Georgian Dream had mounted a \"constitutional coup\", while analysts said its increased vote share from four years ago was scarcely credible. Both Georgian Dream and the four pro-EU opposition groups trying to end its 12 years in power had earlier claimed victory based on competing exit polls. Voters turned out in big numbers on Saturday in this South Caucasus state bordering Russia, and there were numerous reports of vote violations and violence outside polling stations. One opposition official in a town south of the capital Tbilisi told the BBC that he was beaten up first by a local Georgian Dream councillor, and then \"another 10 men came and I didn’t know what was happening to me\". A coalition of 2,000 election observers called My Vote said given the scale of vote-fraud and violence it did not believe the preliminary results \"reflect the will of Georgian citizens\". The opposition has described this high-stakes vote as a choice between Europe or Russia. Many saw the vote as the most crucial since Georgians backed independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. As soon as voting ended, two exit polls by Edison and HarrisX for pro-opposition TV channels gave Georgian Dream 40.9% and 42% of the vote, with the total for the combined four opposition groups put at 51.9% and 48%. But a poll for the big, government-supporting Imedi TV channel gave Georgian Dream 56%. Some time later, the central election commission (CEC) came out with initial preliminary results. The commission had said that 90% of the vote would be released within two hours of the polls closing enabled by new electronic vote-counting system, but it was only on Sunday morning the preliminary results were almost complete. The CEC has come under criticism for being too close to the government and for rushing through electoral reform ahead of the election without sufficient consultation. Former Georgian ambassador to the EU Natalie Sabanadze said the commission was \"fully in the hands of the ruling party now”. However, commission chairman Giorgi Kalandarishvili said the vote system had been internationally audited and only 20 out of 15,000 machines had failed. \"The onus is on a government body to provide transparency required in an electoral process,\" said Dritan Nesho of HarrisX. \"We analysed the data from these precincts and there’s a wide discrepancy from the data we have. In some cases they have precincts in Tbilisi where Georgian Dream are winning by more than 45% of the vote, whereas we know most of the opposition vote came from Tbilisi.\" Georgian Dream is set to have 91 seats in the 150-seat parliament, according to the contested results that give the opposition groups a total of 37% of the vote. Under Georgia's new system of proportional representation, many of the other parties failed to reach the 5% threshold to get into parliament. Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s, told supporters it was a \"rare occasion in the world for the same party to achieve such success in such a difficult situation\". However, opposition leaders and supporters had a very different take. Tina Bokuchava said her party would not accept Georgia's European future being stolen and she hoped the other main opposition groups would be able to agree on their next steps. \"This is the moment. In future there may be no such moment,\" opposition voter Levan Benidze, 36, told the BBC. \"I know there are a lot of geopolitical risks - from Russia - but this could be the pivotal moment, a turning point.\" Although Georgia was made a candidate to join the European Union last December, that move has since been frozen by the EU because of \"democratic backsliding - in particular a Russian-style \"foreign influence\" law targeting groups receiving Western funding. The USSR may have ceased to exist more than three decades ago, but Moscow still considers much of the old Soviet empire its own backyard and Russia’s sphere of influence. It will have appreciated Georgian Dream’s campaign promise of a “pragmatic” Russia policy, not to mention Brussels’ decision earlier this year to halt Georgia’s EU accession process. Georgian Dream has promised voters they are still on course to join the EU, but it has also accused the opposition of helping the West to open a new front in Russia's war in Ukraine. Georgia's Russian neighbour still occupies 20% of its territory after a five-day war in 2008. Bidzina Ivanishvili's rhetoric has become increasingly anti-Western, indicating that a fourth term for Georgian Dream might pull the country back into Russia's orbit. Georgians had a simple choice, the party's founder said after voting in Tbilisi: either a government that served them, or an opposition of \"foreign agents, who will carry out only the orders of a foreign country\". He has repeatedly spoken of a \"global war party\" pushing the opposition towards joining the war in Ukraine, with Georgian Dream (GD) cast as the party of peace. For many voters the message has worked. \"The most important thing - for me, my family, my grandchildren - is peace that I wish for all Georgians,\" GD voter Tinatin Gvelesiani, 55, told the BBC at a polling station in Kojori, south-west of the capital. \"Only Georgian Dream\" would bring peace, she added. Election observers reported a string of violations across the country, from ballot stuffing inside polling stations to intimidation of voters outside. With less than an hour to go before the polls closed, pro-Western President Salome Zourabichvili appealed to opposition voters not to be intimidated. \"Don't get scared. All this is just psychological pressure on you,\" she said in a live address on social media. The intimidation turned into violence for Azat Karimov, 35, the local chair of the biggest opposition party United National Movement in Marneuli south of Tbilisi. He told the BBC how he was set upon when his team tried to investigate votes being falsified by Georgian Dream officials. \"[A Georgian Dream councillor]came with 10-20 people... before police could come I told him to calm down. Right away the councillor started beating me.\" On the eve of the vote, a Georgian monitoring group highlighted a Russian disinformation campaign aimed at the election. The Kremlin has denied meddling in Georgia’s domestic affairs and alleged instead that the West had made “unprecedented attempts” at interference. Earlier this year Sergei Naryshkin, director of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, the SVR, accused the United States of planning a “Colour Revolution” in Georgia.",

        "headline": "Sudan civil war: RSF accused by UN of 'atrocities crimes' in Gezira state",
        "text": "A senior UN official in Sudan says she is deeply troubled by reports of \"atrocious crimes\" in the central Gezira state, including the mass killing of civilians by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Clementine Nkweta-Salami's comments came after an activist group said that at least 124 people were killed by the RSF in attacks on villagers over the past week. The RSF has denied targeting civilians, saying its fighters are clashing with militias armed by the military. The 18-month conflict in Sudan has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced more than 11 million.  Gezira state turned into a major battleground last week after the RSF suffered a major blow when one of its commanders, Abu Aqla Kayka, defected to the military. The army said he had brought \"a large number of his forces\" with him, in what it described as the first high-profile defection to its side. In response, the RSF said its fighters would defend themselves and \"decisively deal with everyone carrying arms\". Ms Nkweta-Salami, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, said that preliminary reports suggested that the RSF had carried out a major attack across the state between 20 and 25 October. She added that it led to mass killings, the raping of women and girls, the widespread looting of markets and homes and the burning down of farms. Ms Nkweta-Salami said the \"atrocious crimes\" were on a scale similar to those seen in Sudan's Darfur region last year, when the RSF was accused of \"ethnic cleansing\" communities seen to be opposed to it. Ms Nkweta-Salami said the death toll was still unclear, but preliminary reports suggested that scores of people were killed in Gezira state. In a statement on Saturday, the Wad Madani Resistance Committee, which campaigns for an end to the conflict and democratic rule in Sudan, said the RSF was committing \"extensive massacres in one village after another\", the Reuters news agency reported. The Sudanese doctors' union called on the UN to push the two sides in the conflict to agree to safe humanitarian corridors into villages that were facing \"genocide\" at the hands of the RSF. The doctors' union added that rescue operations had become impossible and that the army was \"incapable\" of protecting civilians. The conflict in Sudan broke out in April 2023 after a fall out between the commanders of the RSF and military,  Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo and Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan respectively. The two had jointly staged a coup in 2021, derailing Sudan's transition to democracy, but then got involved in a vicious power struggle. The two leaders have refused to sign a peace deal, despite efforts by the US and Saudi Arabia to broker an end to the conflict.  Go toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.

        "headline": "We took on Google and forced them to pay out £2bn",
        "text": "\"Google essentially disappeared us from the internet.\" Launch days. They’re equal parts thrilling and terrifying for many start-up business founders, but they don’t get much worse than the one Shivaun Raff and her husband, Adam, experienced. It was June 2006 and the couple’s trailblazing price comparison website Foundem - one they had sacrificed well-paid jobs for and built from scratch - had just gone fully live. They didn’t know it at the time but that day, and those that followed, would mark the beginning of the end for their company. Foundem had been hit by a Google search penalty, prompted by one of the search engine’s automatic spam filters. It pushed the website way down the lists of search results for relevant queries like \"price comparison\" and \"comparison shopping\". It meant the couple’s website, which charged a fee when customers clicked on their product listings through to other websites, struggled to make any money. \"We were monitoring our pages and how they were ranking, and then we saw them all plummet almost immediately, \" says Adam. While the launch day for Foundem didn't go to plan, it would lead to the start of something else – a 15-year legal battle that culminated in a thenrecord €2.4bn (£2bn) fine for Google, which was deemed to have abused its market dominance. The case has been hailed as a landmark moment in the global regulation of Big Tech. Google spent seven years fighting that verdict, issued in June 2017, but in September this year Europe’s top court – the European Court of Justice – rejected its appeals. Speaking to Radio 4’s The Bottom Linein their first interview since that final verdict, Shivaun and Adam explained that at first, they thought their website’s faltering start had simply been a mistake. “We initially thought this was collateral damage, that we had been false positive detected as spam,” says Shivaun, 55. “We just assumed we had to escalate to the right place and it would be overturned.” \"If you're denied traffic, then you have no business,\" adds Adam, 58. The couple sent Google numerous requests to have the restriction lifted but, more than two years later, nothing had changed and they said they received no response. Meanwhile, their website was \"ranking completely normally\" on other search engines, but that didn't really matter, according to Shivaun, as \"everyone's using Google\". The couple would later discover that their site was not the only one to have been put at a disadvantage by Google – by the time the tech giant was found guilty and fined in 2017 there were around 20 claimants, including Kelkoo, Trivago and Yelp. Adam, who had built a career in supercomputing, says he had the \"eureka moment\" for Foundem while smoking a cigarette outside the offices of his previous employer. Then, price comparison websites were in their infancy, and each specialised in one particular product. But Foundem was different because it let customers compare a large range of products – from clothes to flights. “No-one else was anywhere close to this,” beams Shivaun, who herself had been a software consultant for several major global brands. In its 2017 judgement, the European Commission found that Google hadillegally promoted its own comparison shopping service in search results, whilst demoting those of competitors. Ten years before that, though – when Foundem launched - Adam says he had no reason to assume Google was being deliberately anti-competitive over online shopping. \"They weren't really serious players,\" he says. But by the end of 2008, the couple had started to suspect foul play. It was three weeks before Christmas and the pair received a message warning that their website had suddenly become slow to load. They thought it was a cyber attack, \"but actually it was just that everyone had started visiting our website\", Adam laughs. Channel 5’s The Gadget Show had just named Foundem the best price comparison website in the UK. “And that was really important,” Shivaun explains, \"because we then reached out to Google and said, look, surely it's not benefiting your users to make it impossible for them to find us. “And that still got from Google, not a complete ignore, but a basically ‘bog off’.” \"That was the moment we knew, OK, we need to fight,\" says Adam. The couple went to the press, with limited success, and took their case to regulators in the UK, US, and Brussels. It was in the latter – with the European Commission (EC) – that the case eventually took off, with the launch of an antitrust investigation in November 2010. The couple’s first meeting with the regulators took place in a portable cabin in Brussels. “One of the things they said was if this is a systemic issue, why are you the first people we’re seeing?” Shivaun recalls. “We said we're not 100% sure, but we suspect people are afraid, because all businesses on the internet essentially rely on Google for the lifeblood that is their traffic.\" The couple were in a hotel room in Brussels, only a few hundred yards from the commission building, when competition commissioner Margarethe Vestager finally announced the verdict that they, and other shopping websites, had been waiting for. But there was no popping of champagne corks. Their focus then turned to making sure the EC enforced its decision. \"I guess it was unfortunate for Google that they did it to us,\" Shivaun says. \"We've both been brought up maybe under the delusion that we can make a difference, and we really don't like bullies.\" Even Google’s final defeat in the case last month did not spell the end for the couple. They believe Google’s conduct remains anti-competitive and the EC is looking into it. In March this year, under its new Digital Markets Act, the commission opened an investigation into Google’s parent company, Alphabet, over whether it continues to preference its own goods and services in search results. A spokesperson for Google said: “The CJEU [European Court of Justice] judgment [in 2024] only relates to how we showed product results from 2008-2017. \"The changes we made in 2017 to comply with the European Commission's Shopping decision have worked successfully for more than seven years, generating billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services. \"For this reason, we continue to strongly contest the claims made by Foundem and will do so when the case is considered by the courts.\" The Raffs are also pursuing a civil damages claim against Google, which is due to begin in the first half of 2026. But when, or if, a final victory comes for the couple it will likely be a Pyrrhic one - they were forced to close Foundem in 2016. The long fight against Google has been gruelling for them, too. \"I think if we had known it was going to be quite as many years as it turned out to be we might not have made the same choice,\" Adam admits.",

        "text": "A singer has apologised after swearing on live TV and \"messing up\" a performance of the US national anthem. Loomis prompted mockery on social media when she performed The Star-Spangled Banner at an independent candidate debate on Wednesday which was broadcast live on TV station C-SPAN, as well as on the radio and online. In an Instagram video posted on Saturday, Loomis called the incident a “mishap” and apologised to the team at Free and Equal Elections, who organised the debate, saying: \"I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to mess up the national anthem.\" “This has been something I’ve been scared of since I was a little girl… I was scared I was gonna fail and then I did, and the world’s seen it,” she said. Videos from the event show her getting flustered on stage as she appears to mess up a note. After singing the line “and the rocket’s red glare”, she swore and said: “Can I go back, can I go back please?” It was only then that the singer found out that the recording was live. “I got too nervous,” she said later on in the performance. The performance has drawn comparisons to previous mishaps during renditions of the US national anthem. Some likened Loomis’ performance to Fergie’s infamous performance of the song at the NBA All-Star Game in 2018. Fergie said at the time that she’d ”wanted to try something special for the NBA” but that it “didn't strike the intended tone”. “Fergie has officially earned her retirement,” one TikTok user wrote in the comments under Loomis’ performance. Country singer Ingrid Andress was also mocked online for her performance of the national anthem at the 2024 MLB Home Run Derby in July. She said the next day that she had been drunk during the song.",

        "headline": "Trump's Joe Rogan interview: Seven takeaways",
        "text": "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump‘s three-hour interview with America’s number one podcaster, Joe Rogan, has been released. In the wide-ranging sit-down, the former president discusses everything from the “biggest mistake” of his White House tenure, what he told North Korea’s leader and whether extraterrestrial life exists. Two years ago Rogan described Trump as “an existential threat to democracy” and refused to have him on his show. But the pair seemed friendly on Friday as they chatted about their shared interest in Ultimate Fighting Championship and mutual friends like Elon Musk. The Republican’s campaign hopes the interview will consolidate his influence with male voters, who make up the core of listeners to the Joe Rogan Experience, which has 14.5 million Spotify followers and 17.5 million YouTube subscribers. Trump took a major detour to visit Rogan in Austin, Texas, causing him to show up almost three hours late to a rally in Traverse City, Michigan, a crucial swing state where both he and his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, have been campaigning hard. Trump told Rogan the “biggest mistake” of his 2017-21 presidency was “I picked a few people I shouldn’t have picked”. “Neocons or bad people or disloyal people,” he told Rogan, referring to neoconservatives, policy-makers who champion an interventionist US foreign policy. “A guy like Kelly, who was a bully but a weak person,” Trump added, mentioning his former White House chief-of-staff John Kelly, who told the New York Times this week that he thought his former boss had “fascist” tendencies. Trump also described his former US National Security Adviser John Bolton as “an idiot”, but useful at times. “He was good in a certain way,” said Trump. “He’s a nutjob. \"And everytime I had to deal with a country when they saw this whack job standing behind me they said: ‘Oh man, Trump’s going to go to war with us.’ He was with Bush when they went stupidly into the Middle East.” Trump said he got to know North Korean leaderKim Jong-un“very well” despite some nuclear sabre-rattling between the two initially when Trump said he told him: “Little Rocket Man, you’re going to burn in hell.” “By the time I finished we had no problem with North Korea,” Trump said. Trump said he urged Kim to stop building up his “substantial” weapons stockpile. “I said: ‘Do you ever do anything else? Why don’t you go take it easy? Go to the beach, relax. “I said: ‘You’re always building nuclear, you don’t have to do it. Relax!’ I said: ‘Let’s build some condos on your shore.’” Trump also argued that Russia would never have invaded Ukraine if he had been president. “I said, ‘Vladimir, you're not going in,’” he told Rogan, referring to Russian PresidentVladimir Putin. “I used to talk to him all the time. “I can't tell you what I told him, because I think it would be inappropriate, but someday he'll tell you, but he would have never gone in.” Trump said Putin invaded Ukraine because “number one, he doesn’t respect Biden at all”. The White House has previously accused Trump of cozying up to foreign autocrats. Asked for proof to back up his false claims that the 2020 presidential was stolen from him by mass voter fraud, Trump told Rogan: “We’ll do it another time. “I would bring in papers that you would not believe, so many different papers. That election was so crooked, it was the most crooked.” Rogan pressed him for evidence. Trump alleged irregularities with the ballots in Wisconsin and that Democrats “used Covid to cheat”. “Are you going to present this [proof] ever?” asked Rogan. “Uh…,” said Trump before pivoting to talk about how 51 former intelligence agents aligned with Joe Biden had falsely suggested that stories about his son Hunter Biden’s laptop were Russian disinformation. “I lost by, like, I didn’t lose,” said Trump, quickly correcting himself. Trump lashed out at his political opponents and praised his allies, many of whom are likely to appeal to Rogan’s fanbase. He called his rival, Vice-President Kamala Harris, a “very low IQ person” and described California's Gavin Newsom as “one of the worst governors in the world”. Trump said that Elon Musk, who has appeared on Rogan’s podcast in the past, was “the greatest guy”. He also said he is \"completely\" committed to bringing Robert F Kennedy Jr into a potential new Trump administration. The former independent presidential candidate, who has a close friendship with Rogan, dropped out in August and endorsed the Republican nominee. Trump said he disagrees with Kennedy on environmental policy so would instead ask the vaccine critic to \"focus on health, do whatever you want\". Trump said that he hadn’t ruled out there being life in space. “There’s no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don’t have life,” he said, referring to discussions he’d had with jet pilots who'd seen “very strange” things in the sky. “Well, Mars - we’ve had probes there, and rovers, and I don’t think there’s any life there,” Rogan said. “Maybe it’s life that we don’t know about,” said Trump. Trump said that some senior figures at NBC had tried to talk him out of running for president to keep his show The Apprentice on air. ”They wanted me to stay,” he said. “All the top people came over to see me, try and talk me out of it, because they wanted to have me extend.” Trump featured in 14 series of The Apprentice from 2004, but NBC cut ties with him after he launched his 2015 bid for the presidency, citing his “derogatory” comments about immigrants. Trump has been under pressure from Democrats to release his medical records after Harris released hers earlier this month, which concluded she was in \"excellent health\" and fit for the presidency. Trump’s team said at the time that his doctor described him as being in \"perfect and excellent health”, without sharing his records. Trump didn’t address the topic directly on Friday’s podcast. But he told Rogan that during one physical, for which he didn’t give a date, doctors had described his ability to run on a steep treadmill as “unbelievable”. \"I was never one that could, like, run on a treadmill. When passing a physical, they asked me to run on a treadmill and then they make it steeper and steeper and steeper and the doctors said, it was at Walter Reed [hospital], they said: 'It’s unbelievable!' I’m telling you, I felt I could have gone all day.” But he said treadmills are “really boring” so he prefers to stay healthy by playing golf.

        "headline": "In Las Vegas, a fight rages for working class Nevada voters",
        "text": "When the sun sets over Las Vegas, Nicole Williams gets to work, serving drinks from behind the bar of an opulent hotel on the city's infamous strip. But life for Ms Williams, 45, and other service-industry workers who form the quiet backbone of Vegas's booming economy, is far from luxurious. \"When you're shopping for a big family like mine, it's rough out here,\" she told the BBC while shopping for groceries and taking children to appointments across town. The mother of seven children, aged 10 months to 16, said she often fears buckling under the weight of the economy. From sky-high prices on groceries to petrol, Ms Williams said she has had to cut back on vacations as well as on football and gymnastics lessons for her kids that would force her to stretch an already strained household budget. \"We haven't been able to do the things we want to do,\" she said. \"I want a future for my kids.\" She is not alone. In dozens of interviews with Las Vegans who work in vital local industries from construction and casinos to restaurants and bars, low-wage workers from across the political spectrum told the BBC that kitchen-table issues -  especially unaffordable housing and costly childcare - are what will determine how they vote on 5 November. It's these voters that Donald Trump and Vice-President Kamala Harris hope to win over in Nevada, a hotly contested battleground state in which the two remain neck-and-neck in the polls. To court low-wage workers, Harris and Trump have laid out starkly different economic visions, including competing anti-poverty policies that could help shape the financial security of millions of families. But victory in unpredictable Nevada - one of the key states which will determine who becomes the next president - will be won by just a tiny fraction of undecided voters there, political insiders say. Data shows that about a third of the state's voters consider themselves independent, with an August New York Times/Siena poll of likely voters showing that a slight majority of independents lean Republican (43%) compared to those who lean Democrat (39%). \"Nevada is not a blue state,\" said Ted Pappageorge, the Secretary-Treasurer of Culinary Union Local 226, referring to the traditional colour of the Democratic Party (the Republicans are red). The politically powerful group has endorsed Harris. \"We're barely purple. If the election happened right now, Trump wins, we think,\" he added. Despite booming business, Nevada's unemployment rate was the highest in the nation at 5.6% in September. In Las Vegas, home to three quarters of the population, the figure stood even higher at 5.9%. The state was also hit particularly hard by the pandemic, when unemployment rose to around 30% - which State Democratic Chair Danielle Monroe-Moreno described as a sign that \"when the country gets a cold, Nevada gets the flu\". As the US economy has rebounded, however, Trump and Harris have pursued contrasting economic policies to alleviate some of the burdens on low-income workers. Harris vowed to expand many of the Covid-era policies President Joe Biden pursued when he took office in 2021, including healthcare and housing subsidies and reviving the enhanced $6,000 child care tax credit. Trump has pushed the idea of renewing his 2017 tax cuts - which are set to expire next year - while imposing sweeping tariffs on foreign imports which he says will reduce poverty and boost economic growth. \"Five dollars isn't $5 anymore, and $100 barely gets you any groceries,\" said Fermin Gonzalez, an unemployed, Mexico-born former restaurant worker living in Las Vegas. At 60 he fears he will have difficulty finding work again. \"We used to be able to make money here. People are dissatisfied.\" To try to persuade voters who feel the same, both parties are relying on door-to-door campaigning efforts by allied get-out-the-vote groups. The Culinary Union - the state's largest union which represents a variety of occupations in hotels and the food service industry - has dozens of teams knocking on doors to drum up support for Harris and other Democratic candidates. On a September afternoon, two members walked for hours in 40C (104F) heat in a modest North Las Vegas neighbourhood near the edge of town, where the city gives way to desert and craggy hills. \"Things are very hard. We feel it a lot,\" said Olga Mexia, a Mexican immigrant and mother of five who works as a housekeeper at the Signature hotel on the strip. \"We're paid so much less for everything. [Four years ago,] rent was less, groceries were less.\" \"I had to have two jobs at one point to make it work. I'm campaigning for my family. Harris at least has a real plan,\" Ms Mexia added, taking shelter from the sun under a tree while her teammate knocked on a door. \"That's the sort of thing people want to talk about.\" One economic proposal where both candidates overlap is ending taxes on tips - a concept that has found a receptive audience among Nevada's service workers, more than half of whom are Latino. More broadly, Latinos represent about 30% of the state's population, along with 19% of its business owners. Given how close the election is likely to be in the state - and nationally - both parties increasingly see the mobilisation of Latino voters as key to their victory. Ms Williams, the bartender - who says she's \"100% voting Trump\" - makes $20 per hour but said tips make up her main income, bringing in as much as $250 on a good night. But even as she uses coupons, bargain hunts and budgets a weekly menu plan, it's not enough. Trump was the first to propose the idea at a Las Vegas rally in June. In August, he again highlighted the plan during a stop at a Mexican-Italian fusion restaurant located on the city's west side. The restaurant is owned by Javier Barajas, a Mexican immigrant who first crossed into the US illegally in 1978 and found himself in Las Vegas, almost by chance, after being separated from his travel companions. Once a dishwasher, Mr Barajas is now a fixture of the community and owns a string of popular Mexican restaurants that employ an overwhelmingly Latino workforce of more than 500. \"My waiters make $12 - the minimum wage. I'm not saying that like it's a lot. It's hard. Every time they go to the gas station they end up spending $100,\" he told the BBC, switching back and forth between English and Spanish in a corner of his restaurant. Mr Barajas, an outspoken Trump supporter, says he believes an end to tax on tips would vastly help his workers with day-to-day expenses, while at the same time having minimal impact on him as an owner. \"That idea is interesting to people like them,\" he said of his workers. \"I completely understand why.\" Harris endorsed the no-tax-on-tips policy at her own Las Vegas rally in August, although in her case it's paired with raising the federal minimum wage to $15. Experts have cautioned that cutting taxes on tips may have minimal benefit on the US economy as a whole, and the Tax Foundation has estimated that any change could cost at least $107bn. Any change would also have to be passed by Congress. For many working-class Las Vegans, inflation and rent pressure are compounded by childcare concerns. Childcare in Nevada is more expensive than anywhere else in the US, with the average family spending nearly $26,000 on it a year - more than a third of their annual average income, according to a July report from the state's Office of Workforce Innovation. Harris has campaigned on a promise that child care costs would be capped at 7% of family income, along with a $6,000 child tax credit. Trump has so far offered no specific plans, although his running-mate Senator JD Vance has proposed raising the child tax credit to $5,000 from its current $2,000. Vance skipped a vote in August on a failed Senate bill that would have expanded the child tax credit for low-income families. Among those feeling the pinch is Dominic Richmond, a 50-year-old single grandmother who cares for four young children with special needs - aged one, four, six and nine - as well as a mother with dementia who lives nearby. Ms Richmond lives in a small two-bedroom apartment that costs her $1,600 per month. While she works part-time as a realtor - a job she said \"leaves no money\" - and 16-hours-a-week at an airline, she said that the combined costs of taking care of the children, rent and high prices have left her in dire straits. \"When you put it all together, it's like a hurricane coming at you,\" she said, wiping away tears at the offices of Children's Cabinet, a local non-profit. \"It's just me doing all this. You can't function in society on 'just me'.\" Once a week, Ms Richmond heads to a crowded food bank, which she says are now mostly distributing self-heating military-style ration packs - which usually include a small main course, crackers or cheese, dessert and a powdered drink -  to help feed her family. She grudgingly asks acquaintances for help - most often with no success. Ms Richmond says she's \"not a political person\" - she just wants a candidate who would help families like hers. \"I'm just hoping that when November gets here, that we will see somebody start to help where the help is needed,\" she said. \"By the end of this year, I'm probably going to be homeless. I've exhausted everything that I can.\"",

        "headline": "US election polls tracker 2024: Who is ahead - Harris or Trump?",
        "text": "Voters in the US go to the polls on 5 November to elect their next president. The election was initially a rematch of 2020 but it was upended in July when President Joe Biden ended his campaign and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris. The big question now is - will America get its first woman president or a second Donald Trump term? As election day approaches, we'll be keeping track of the polls and seeing what effect the campaign has on the race for the White House. Harris has had a small lead over Trump in the national polling averages since she entered the race at the end of July and she remains ahead - as shown in the chart below with the latest figures rounded to the nearest whole number. Harris saw a bounce in her polling numbers in the first few weeks of her campaign, building a lead of nearly four percentage points towards the end of August. The numbers were relatively stable through September, even after the only debate between the two candidates on 10 September, which was watched by nearly 70 million people. In the last few days the gap between them has tightened, as you can see in the poll tracker chart below, with the trend lines showing the averages and the dots showing the individual poll results for each candidate. While these national polls are a useful guide as to how popular a candidate is across the country as a whole, they're not necessarily an accurate way to predict the result of the election. That's because the US uses an electoral college system, in which each state is given a number of votes roughly in line with the size of its population. A total of 538 electoral college votes are up for grabs, so a candidate needs to hit 270 to win. There are 50 states in the US but because most of them nearly always vote for the same party, in reality there are just a handful where both candidates stand a chance of winning. These are the places where the election will be won and lost and are known as battleground states or swing states. Right now the polls are very tight in the seven states considered battlegrounds in this election and neither candidate has a decisive lead in any of them, according to the polling averages. If you look at the trends since Harris joined the race, it does help highlight some differences between the states - but it’s important to note that there are fewer state polls than national polls so we have less data to go on and every poll has a margin of error that means the numbers could be higher or lower. In Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina, the lead has changed hands a few times since the start of August but Trump has a small lead in all of them at the moment. In the three other states - Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - Harris had led since the start of August, sometimes by two or three points, but in recent days the polls have tightened significantly and Trump now has a very small lead in Pennsylvania. All three of those states had been Democratic strongholds before Trump turned them red on his path to winning the presidency in 2016. Biden retook them in 2020 and if Harris can do the same then she will be on course to win the election. In a sign of how the race has changed since Harris became the Democratic nominee, on the day that Biden quit the race he was trailing Trump by nearly five percentage points on average in the seven swing states. In Pennsylvania, Biden was behind by nearly 4.5 percentage points when he dropped out, as the chart below shows. It is a key state for both campaigns as it has the highest number of electoral votes of the seven and therefore winning it makes it easier to reach the 270 votes needed. The figures we have used in the graphics above are averages created bypolling analysis website 538, which is part of American news network ABC News. To create them, 538 collects the data from individual polls carried out both nationally and in battleground states by lots of polling companies. As part of its quality control, 538 only includes polls from companies that meet certain criteria, like being transparent about how many people they polled, when the poll was carried out and how the poll was conducted (telephone calls, text message, online, etc). You can read more about the 538 methodologyhere. At the moment, the polls suggest that Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are within a couple of percentage points of each other in all of the swing states - and when the race is that close, it’s very hard to predict winners. Polls underestimated support for Trump in both 2016 and 2020. Polling companies will be trying to fix that problem in a number of ways, including how to make their results reflect the make-up of the voting population. Those adjustments are difficult to get right and pollsters still have to make educated guesses about other factors like who will actually turn up to vote on 5 November.

        "headline": "Whitby Goth Weekend: The town where a subculture feels safe",
        "text": "Thirty years since the seaside town hosted its first Goth Weekend, Whitby is still a \"safe and accepting\" place, say regular visitors to the festival. Held annually in April and October, the gothic gathering began in 1994 and now attracts large crowds to Whitby's cobbled streets. Inspired by the town's association with Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, it started out as a one-off meeting of pen-friends in The Elsinore pub. This year’s celebrations will take place from 1 November and include live music and stalls, with a 30th birthday party planned for 3 November. Elaine Horton, owner of goth shop Pandemonium, said her business would not exist without the boost in trade from the two weekends. Her alternative store sells clothing, shoes, babywear, hair accessories, jewellery and gifts and first opened in 1999. Ms Horton said there was a large variation within the subculture. \"Believe it or not there are probably around 35 types of goth,\" she said. \"There are a lot of people who come into Whitby just for the architecture, they come to Goth Weekend because they like the clothing, they like the music, some people like all of it,\" she added. Members of The Sophie Lancaster Foundation charity have been attending Whitby Goth Weekend since the 20-year-old was killed in 2007. She died after a group of boys attacked her and her boyfriend in a park in Lancashire while they were dressed in gothic clothing. Two of them were convicted of murder. The foundation has a stall at the festival to raise money for its work, educate people and keep her memory alive. Elloise Dickinson, education and engagement manager, said the event was a “special place for the foundation”. “The Whitby goths have always been there for us,\" she said. “We meet people who would see Sophie in Manchester or know people who knew her and even those who don’t come up and say: ‘We resonate with her story.’ ” Ms Dickinson said the town felt like a “second home” for the foundation. “Our heart is there,” she said. “In a place like Whitby there’s so much support. “The festival gives a chance for alternative people to come out in finery and express themselves and feel safe. “It’s important for others to see alternative people look so amazing in a way they feel comfortable. “I’ve seen people as old as 80 or 90 but also children as young as four or five who are just getting into it. “It’s really important to celebrate difference in culture and celebrate diversity.” \"Dr Crank\", who runs ghost walks, said he had watched the goth festival grow into a \"worldwide event\". “The reason the goths like to come to Whitby, especially this time of the year, is it’s atmospheric,\" he said. Dr Crank, who also holds Halloween walks and a Dracula-themed tour, added: “You get goths from all over the world coming to Whitby, we welcome them all. “Whitby’s a very accepting town and every year they bring colour – mainly black or purple.\" Merryn Wilderspin, an artist and designer from Malton, has created two Whitby Goth Weekend collections of her made-to-order designer bags. She said: “I thought Whitby’s goth and steampunk activities could make for interesting themes.\" Despite admitting she “can’t falsely claim to be a die-hard goth”, she said the weekend had a “fun atmosphere” and she loved being part of it. She said: “Goth is so much to do with fashion and music, which are natural parts of my life. “With the collections, I thought people would like to have something they can use in an everyday sense that offers a goth flavour without it being too obvious.” Listen to highlights fromNorth Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latestepisode of Look Northor tell us a story you thinkwe should be covering here.",

        "headline": "The Bradford nurse who married train driver who saved her life",
        "text": "Warning: This article contains references to suicide and mental health issues. On a summer afternoon in 2019, nurse Charlotte Lay got ready for her night shift as normal but \"wasn't feeling quite right\". Within a short space of time she had decided to end her own life close to a West Yorkshire railway station. But thanks to the kindness of the train driver who found her in crisis, she did not go through with it. Three years later they married each other and went on to have children. \"I'd struggled with my mental health since my teens and I'd been in and out of the system since,\" Charlotte, now 33, says. Her memories of that day five years ago are \"quite blurry\" but she says she remembers seeing a train pulling up on the tracks where she was, close to Crossflatts Station, near Bradford. \"I remember seeing a man getting off the train and starting to panic and thinking he was going to tell me off,\" she recalls. \"He approached me and said 'hi, my name is Dave, are you having a bad day?' \"I said ‘yeah, just a bit’. He went ‘OK’, we can sit and talk until it feels better.\" Dave, who works for train operator Northern, remembers getting out of his cab, \"kneeling down\" in front of Charlotte and introducing himself. He told her they would talk things through \"until you feel comfortable enough\" to get onto the train, where she could be taken to safety. The pair talked for half an hour, by which time Charlotte, though still distressed, agreed to get into the cab. She was taken to Skipton Station and left in the care of the police. The following day, Charlotte was desperate to find the man who had been so kind to her and issued an appeal on a local Facebook group for anyone who worked for Northern who might be able to put her in touch. \"I’d have understood if he didn’t want to hear from me, but I just wanted to say ‘thank you’ for giving me the time and for treating me like I was human being,\" she says. Her plea was successful and after Charlotte was given Dave's number by one of his colleagues who had seen the appeal, she sent him a text. Dave, who is now 47, was equally relieved to hear from her. He says he had \"never had the opportunity\" to get off the train and talk to someone in crisis before. \"I needed to know she was all right,\" he explains. \"I’d contacted police to try to find out what happened to her and just wanted to make sure she was safe. \"I felt like I’d had a duty to make sure she was all right. We’d had that rapport built by the side of the track. It was just nice to be able to make that difference to somebody.\" After Dave returned Charlotte's text telling her he was available whenever she needed to speak to someone, they began exchanging messages on a daily basis. They then met for a coffee two months later and the rest was history. In 2022, the couple, who live in nearby Wilsden, got married, with Charlotte 22 weeks pregnant. But before then, there was one more twist to their story. In July 2020, Dave was diagnosed with testicular cancer, after he went to his GP with a bad back. He is adamant that he would never have gone to the doctors were it not for Charlotte's insistence. \"It's because I'm a bloke,\" he says. \"I'd done 12 or 13 years in the motor trade working on cold floors and out in the elements, lifting and carrying silly things. I just put it down to a bad back. \"Charlotte kept saying 'go to the doctors'. I said it was just me getting old.\" Weeks after his diagnosis, Dave was given the all clear. A consultant at St James' Hospital in Leeds last year told him he would no longer have been alive had he not had been diagnosed when he was. \"Charlotte may say I saved her life, which I don’t know about really, but she saved my life as well,\" Dave says. The couple say they wanted to share their story in the hope that anyone who is struggling can know better times are around the corner. \"Life does get better,\" Charlotte, who is now a mum of three, says. \"You just have to be here to see it.\" Charlotte says that it is often too difficult for people who are struggling to \"reach out\" and ask for help, so suggests people around them \"reach in\" instead. She continues to receive ongoing support for her mental health. She believes asking someone if they are OK more than once can help them open up. \"We owe it to each other to be checking in with people around us,\" she says. \"You don't have to offer life-changing advice or say anything profound. Just sitting down with a cuppa can make all the difference. \"Because of what I’ve been through, I had a duty to talk about it and I’m hoping it’s going to be a conversation starter.\" Listen to highlights fromWest Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latestepisode of Look Northor tell us a story you thinkwe should be covering here.",

        "headline": "Pixies: 'The more you try to recapture youth, the sillier it sounds'",
        "text": "Pixies frontman Black Francis wouldn't be your first pick to read the CBeebies Bedtime Story. Over the course of his band's wildly influential career, his fractured, often abstract songs have referenced Biblical violence, mutilation, incest, torture and death. \"Sliced up eyeballs\" and \"goats of lust\" aren't traditionally the sort of images that help your toddler drift off to sleep. Luckily, he didn't recite his own lyrics when he popped into CBeebies earlier this month. The book he chose did have a distinct Pixies flavour, though. It's called There Was A Young Zombie Who Swallowed A Worm \"I usually don't do things like that, but I enjoyed it,\" the 59-year-old says. \"My girlfriend sort of insisted, so I did it with feeling and, you know, I raised five kids, so I'm pretty good at bedtime stories.\" It's hard to imagine Pixies appearing on children's television at any other point in their career. The abrasive riffs and intertwining harmonies of songs like Debaser, Monkey Gone To Heaven, and Where Is My Mind signposted the future of alternative rock in the late 1980s; and they were cited as inspirations by everyone from Nirvana and Radiohead to... er, James Blunt. (\"They'd be furious to hear that, wouldn't they?\" he recently said). Just as the artists they inspired began to hit the mainstream, the band broke up - but their reputation grew in their absence. In 2003, the NME named their 1989 album Doolittle (recorded for $40,000 in the basement of a hair salon) the second-best record of all time. Twelve years later, it sold its 300,000th copy in the UK, gaining the band their first ever platinum record, 30 years after they formed. By that point, they'd reunited for a first-rate second phase. When we speak, they're about to set off on an Australian stadium tour with Pearl Jam. \"Our audience just seems to get bigger all the time,\" Francis says... Hence the cameo on CBeebies. Pixies formed in 1986, when Francis (born Charles Thompson IV) dropped out of university and persuaded his guitarist room-mate Joey Santiago to do the same. A local newspaper ad brought in bassist Kim Deal and, through her, drummer Dave Lovering. A buzzy demo tape won them a contract with British label 4AD, and they were quickly embraced by the indie music press, where one writer described their corrosive sound as \"a wild new shock\". But the secret to their success, Francis says, is simplicity. He describes the first time Pixies headlined Reading festival in 1990. Further down the bill was a group whose show was a \"very Vegas kind of affair\". \"They had lights and confetti and balloons,\" he recalls. \"A lot of schtick going on. \"Their tour manager turned to our manager, Chas Banks, and said, 'So what do you have prepared for your set?\" \"And he replied, '25 good songs'\". \"I was very proud that that's how he responded, because that is literally all we had. We had no dance moves, we had no balloons, we literally just had our music. There's a tussle in the music, too, which vacillates between blood-curdling punk and what the band called \"dust-bowl songs\" - country-tinged, heartland folk ballads. Lovering has said the album is \"more traditional\" than earlier Pixies records. Francis says those seeds were sown in his 1990s solo work. \"I'm going to go out on a limb here, and I'll say something that I've not said in an interview before,\" he says. \"When the Pixies broke up, I began to allow myself to stand outside of so-called underground music. I even went and made a couple of records at Nashville. \"And when we got back together, there was a lot of reticence from the producers and, quietly, behind-the-scenes, the managers, who were trying to make sure that Charles didn't turn it into some sort of 'country thing'. \"I think I deferred to that somewhat, but I didn't feel like the results were necessarily notable. So I started to allow more of that stuff into the mix. \"And I think everyone around me has, consciously or unconsciously, relaxed and allowed me to do it.\" He warms to the theme, saying it's unreasonable to expect a band in their fifth decade to re-capture the spittle-flecked anger of youth. \"It gets harder to do those kind of things, because when you're young, there's so much naïvete driving the bus. Even if the song compositionally is flimsy, you make up for it with all that energy. \"But what happens is you get better at playing guitar, better at composing, and that naïve energy is gone. It's very hard to tap into it. It's much easier to tap into the I-know-what-the-hell-I'm-doing energy. \"And maybe that's not what people want to hear but, you know what? I can't be 19 years old again. And the harder you try, the sillier it sounds.\" One of his new songs disproves that theory. Oyster Beds is two minutes of lean, vigorous riffs coupled with what, on the surface, appear to be some of Francis's most surreal lyrics to date: \"A musketeer and her two deers / A country house in Dadasphere.\" In fact, he wrote the song in his art studio, and the lyrics are \"a little laundry list of things I've painted in the last few years\". \"I was kind of like, 'I just need some words here', and it's a punky song, so I wasn't feeling strongly about the message. What does he get from painting that music doesn't provide? \"Solace [from] other people,\" he laughs. \"Not that playing with people is bad, because it gives you companionship, but sometimes it can get laborious. \"With painting, I realised, 'Oh, I can do this and have all of the debates and fights in my head, and there's no one to answer to'.\" He proceeds to describe that process at entertaining length. \"So if the brushes are driving the bus, I'll be like, 'Don't forget about your narrative'. But then my inner monologue will go, 'Screw the narrative, because right now big brush is in charge and big brush is making a big mess'. \"Then it'll be like, 'Alright, you've ruined the painting enough, it's time to think about what this painting is about. We've got to let figurative take over for a while to bring some order to all this chaos'. \"And so it becomes this argument between the different elements of the painting. They're all professors at the Black Francis art school, and I really enjoy that. \"It's crazy, even insane, what's going on in my head, but I do it for hours.\" Crazy, maybe, but the most compelling art comes from creative chaos - and that's why, after all these years, Pixies are still a thrill.",

        "headline": "Botswana election: President Masisi's BDP wants five more years in power",
        "text": "Botswana’s governing party - in power for almost six decades - is trying to pull off a trick in Wednesday’s general election by using a phrase normally associated with long-suffering opposition groups. In its manifesto, the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) is calling for “change”. “Let’s change together and build prosperity for all,” President Mokgweetsi Masisi - in charge of the country since 2018 – writes in the introduction. It is an acknowledgement that things need to be done differently - the opposition argues that the president’s party is not in a position to do that. Though analysts say the outcome of the election is hard to predict this time, the BDP has won handsome parliamentary majorities at the 11 elections since independence in 1966. It subsequently secured the presidency every time as MPs elect the head of state. The BDP has been credited with overseeing a peaceful and dramatic transformation of a poor country, with only a few kilometres of tarred roads at independence, into a place where average living standards are among the highest on the continent. Underpinning this transformation has been Botswana’s huge diamond reserves - measured by their value, the country is the world’s largest producer of the gemstone. And yet all is not well. Botswana is facing big economic challenges - hence Masisi's talk of change. More than one in four of the working population is unemployed, with an even higher proportion among younger people, according to the World Bank. Politics professor at the University of Botswana Zibani Maundeni described it as a “jobless economy”. “We are producing graduates every year and the economy is not producing enough jobs for them,”he told the BBC’s Africa Daily podcast.  In addition, Botswana’s wealth is not evenly spread around among its 2.3 million people. By a measure known as the Gini index, researchers say it isone of the most unequal countries in the world. And the diamond industry appears to be under pressure globally as demand has been falling. But Masisi and his party continue to project confidence. At a campaign rally in an opposition stronghold in central Botswana, the president arrived in style in an electric vehicle assembled in the country. Getting out, the 63-year-old former teacher danced towards the stage greeting supporters in red-and-white party colours. Laughter rang through the crowd as Masisi’s humour and charisma electrified the audience. The area - home to the previous President, Ian Khama - elected three opposition MPs in 2019. This was after Khama defected from the BDP to help form the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF), saying he regretted picking Masisi as his successor. The dramatic fall-out between the two men led to Khama leaving the country, accusing the government of trying to poison him. Khama was then charged with money laundering, among other crimes, all of which he denies.  It also ended the political dominance of his family - his father, Sir Seretse Khama, was the country's first president and served for 14 years from 1966. “I am sorry, please come back home and also call others over,” Masisi told the rally pleading to voters to return to the BDP. Hair-salon owner, Thandiwe Potso, 32, seemed convinced. “Masisi truly understands our challenges and brought better programmes to fund our businesses,” she told the BBC, her eyes shining with conviction. Kabelo Selemo, 45, agreed. “His policies have helped us grow as you can see we no longer import vegetables. I believe in his vision for our future,” said the small-business owner. But according to an opinion poll, many others may not be so easy to convince. Respected non-partisan polling organisationAfrobarometer released a damming report earlier this year. It said that despite the country ranking highly in good governance on the continent, people in Botswana had a negative view of the government believing there were high levels of corruption. “Strong majorities express little or no trust in the incumbent and disapprove of the way he has performed his job,” it said. BDP spokesperson Kagelelo Banks Kentse questioned the credibility of the poll. He argued that Afrobarometer had in previous elections underestimated support for the BDP and thought it would be no different this time. Though the party is not taking anything for granted. “I would be very wrong to say that we are over-confident,” Kentse told the BBC. “I always hear people saying: ‘This is the toughest election we’ve come across’, but we say that in every election year. You never win before the actual vote.” He admitted that the unemployment rate did not paint a good picture, but argued that every nation on the continent was experiencing similar problems, adding that his party was pledging to create 300,000 more jobs. Kentse also touted the toughly negotiated deal that Masisi struck with diamond firm De Beers last year for Botswana to benefit more from its natural resources. Initially the state will get a 30% share of the rough diamonds mined in the country, an increase on the 25% it got previously, rising to 50% within 10 years. But Dumelang Saleshando, leader of one of the largest opposition parties, argued that the government has just copied others’ ideas. He said his Botswana Congress Party (BCP) had first set a jobs target, which the BDP had previously rejected saying it was better to leave things to the free market. One of the slogans Saleshando is deploying is: “Save Botswana”. “I think people have seen the BDP for what it is,” he told the BBC. “It certainly cannot argue that it is an agent of change. In the past it has always tried to say it’s about keeping stability - more of the same - and out of panic they are trying to preach what they don’t believe in.” Supporters of another opposition party - the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), which got the second largest share of the vote in 2019, came out in their numbers in the north of the capital, Gaborone. Dressed in blue-and-white T-shirts and sun hats, they cheered leader Duma Boko. Unlike Masisi, Boko generally remained serious, in order to emphasise how much the people were suffering under the BDP. He alleged that there were attempts to rig the poll. “I urge you all to be vigilant and after voting out the BDP you remain at the polling station to guard your vote,” he said. Thapelo Dimpe, a 45-year-old former teacher, has no doubts about why he wants to see the president's partydefeated. “Masisi has let us down on education reform. The UDC plans to invest in our schools and empower our youth with the education they deserve,” he said. Although the government has a host of problems that could dent its support, opposition divisions could enable the BDP to stay in power. Every MP is elected on a first-past-the-post basis, meaning that to win a seat, the BDP only needs the largest number of votes in a constituency rather than more than 50%. In a seat where the UDC, BCP or BPF – or a number of other parties – are running, it could mean that the opposition vote is split, allowing the BDP to get in. “These parties seem to have factionalism within themselves, they keep taking internal issues to the media – they are not really united,” political analyst Lesole Machacha told the BBC. But he also pointed out that the BDP had its own problems. “The ruling party is not 100% intact – it is also having issues. In some constituencies BDP politicians who were not happy with the primary process are running as independent candidates, which could divide that vote,” Mr Machacha said. All this makes for a closely fought and unpredictable election, he added. For one of Africa’s most successful political parties, the question now is whether enough people are convinced that it can oversee the change that the country needs.

        "headline": "WordPress v WP Engine: Why the feud matters to the internet",
        "text": "One of the world's biggest web publishing platforms - used by a large chunk of the internet - is locked in a spat which is affecting thousands of businesses worldwide. While most of the work WordPress does is not seen by internet users, it says its behind-the-scenes web-building toolspower 40%of the world's websites. That means its disagreement with a company called WP Engine is causing disruption to the huge number businesses that rely on the two organisations to keep their websites running. Tricia Fox, who runs an agency that manages about 70 websites - and is caught up in the row - told the BBC: \"I can't run a business on this level of uncertainty.\" The very wide use of WordPress makes it \"crucial to the internet\", according to Daniel Card, fellow of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT. But that also means \"its actions definitely have a big ripple effect online\", he says - a ripple effect firms like Tricia Fox's are starting to really feel. The row between the companies begins with the fact that WordPress has two sides: its non-profit organisation, called WordPress.org, and its profit-making arm, called Automattic. WordPress.org makes its source code open, which mean anyone can use it to create and redistribute their own tools for free. That's what WP Engine does to run a web hosting service. But in return for the source code, WordPress expects those who use it to contribute to its maintenance, for example by fixing bugs and testing new features. The boss of WordPress accuses WP Engine of failing to do so, going so far as to call it \"a cancer to WordPress.\" As a result, in late September, hebannedWP Engine from using key parts of WordPress. WP Engine rejects these claims. \"We are proud of our extensive contributions to the WordPress ecosystem,\" WP Enginewrotein a post on X/Twitter. Caught in the middle of this row are the countless websites and blogs that rely on the two companies services. People like Tricia Fox, who uses a WP Engine subsidiary to host the websites her company serves. She now says she is \"almost certain\" to migrate her websites to a different host - a decision which she says is worth \"tens of thousands of pounds\" over the next few years. She wants to move away from WP Engine because the fallout has resulted in dozens of hours of extra work for her staff - increasing costs for her business. \"The team don't know if it's going to work today or not,\" Ms Fox told the BBC. But she worries even a costly move away from WP Engine may not solve her problems, as she would still be using another host based on the WordPress code. \"What's to stop WordPress from doing this again [to another company]?\" she asks. \"Right now we are currently focused on resolving our dispute with WP Engine,\" WordPress said when the BBC asked if it would go after other companies in a similar manner. The row also underscores how important the open source principle is to the online economy. While big tech might attract the headlines, for many people and businesses it is something much less eye-catching that keeps them afloat. \"Open source is all about sharing code and standards so everyone benefits, and it’s a huge part of what makes the internet work,\" says Daniel Card. And with WordPress being such a big player in that world, if it makes changes to its tools, he adds, \"it’s felt by users everywhere and often impacts hosting, plugins, and web standards across the internet.\" While much of the spat between the two sides has taken place through official social media accounts and blog posts, it has also entered the courtroom. WordPress.org cannot force WP Engine to contribute to its open source project - but it does have control over its trademarks. It argues that WP Engine mentions WordPress in its marketing tools to help sell its product - and therefore should pay to use the trademark. \"Any business making hundreds of millions of dollars off of an open source project ought to give back, and if they don't, then they can’t use its trademarks,\" Mr Mullenweg wrote in ablog post. The trademarks do not cover the \"WP\" abbreviation, but theWordPress Foundationsays: \"please don’t use it in a way that confuses people\". WP Engine has meanwhilefileda legal case against Mr Mullenweg and Automattic, with accusations of attempted extortion, libel and a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act among its complaints. It claims Automattic told WP Engine they would have to pay \"tens of millions of dollars\" in order to continue using the WordPress trademarks. WP Engine has sinceaskedfor the legal process to be sped up as its businesses are suffering. Its recent filing claimed the number of cancellation requests it receives have increased by 14% compared to normal trading, as a result of the disruption. It said it it is also losing out on potential new customers due to uncertainty over its future access to WordPress products. Automattic has called the lawsuit \"baseless\" and \"flawed, start to finish.\" \"We vehemently deny WP Engine’s allegations - which are gross mischaracterizations of reality,\" it said in a statement, adding that it would \"vigorously litigate against this absurd filing\".",

        "headline": "The Bradford nurse who married train driver who saved her life",
        "text": "Warning: This article contains references to suicide and mental health issues. On a summer afternoon in 2019, nurse Charlotte Lay got ready for her night shift as normal but \"wasn't feeling quite right\". Within a short space of time she had decided to end her own life close to a West Yorkshire railway station. But thanks to the kindness of the train driver who found her in crisis, she did not go through with it. Three years later they married each other and went on to have children. \"I'd struggled with my mental health since my teens and I'd been in and out of the system since,\" Charlotte, now 33, says. Her memories of that day five years ago are \"quite blurry\" but she says she remembers seeing a train pulling up on the tracks where she was, close to Crossflatts Station, near Bradford. \"I remember seeing a man getting off the train and starting to panic and thinking he was going to tell me off,\" she recalls. \"He approached me and said 'hi, my name is Dave, are you having a bad day?' \"I said ‘yeah, just a bit’. He went ‘OK’, we can sit and talk until it feels better.\" Dave, who works for train operator Northern, remembers getting out of his cab, \"kneeling down\" in front of Charlotte and introducing himself. He told her they would talk things through \"until you feel comfortable enough\" to get onto the train, where she could be taken to safety. The pair talked for half an hour, by which time Charlotte, though still distressed, agreed to get into the cab. She was taken to Skipton Station and left in the care of the police. The following day, Charlotte was desperate to find the man who had been so kind to her and issued an appeal on a local Facebook group for anyone who worked for Northern who might be able to put her in touch. \"I’d have understood if he didn’t want to hear from me, but I just wanted to say ‘thank you’ for giving me the time and for treating me like I was human being,\" she says. Her plea was successful and after Charlotte was given Dave's number by one of his colleagues who had seen the appeal, she sent him a text. Dave, who is now 47, was equally relieved to hear from her. He says he had \"never had the opportunity\" to get off the train and talk to someone in crisis before. \"I needed to know she was all right,\" he explains. \"I’d contacted police to try to find out what happened to her and just wanted to make sure she was safe. \"I felt like I’d had a duty to make sure she was all right. We’d had that rapport built by the side of the track. It was just nice to be able to make that difference to somebody.\" After Dave returned Charlotte's text telling her he was available whenever she needed to speak to someone, they began exchanging messages on a daily basis. They then met for a coffee two months later and the rest was history. In 2022, the couple, who live in nearby Wilsden, got married, with Charlotte 22 weeks pregnant. But before then, there was one more twist to their story. In July 2020, Dave was diagnosed with testicular cancer, after he went to his GP with a bad back. He is adamant that he would never have gone to the doctors were it not for Charlotte's insistence. \"It's because I'm a bloke,\" he says. \"I'd done 12 or 13 years in the motor trade working on cold floors and out in the elements, lifting and carrying silly things. I just put it down to a bad back. \"Charlotte kept saying 'go to the doctors'. I said it was just me getting old.\" Weeks after his diagnosis, Dave was given the all clear. A consultant at St James' Hospital in Leeds last year told him he would no longer have been alive had he not had been diagnosed when he was. \"Charlotte may say I saved her life, which I don’t know about really, but she saved my life as well,\" Dave says. The couple say they wanted to share their story in the hope that anyone who is struggling can know better times are around the corner. \"Life does get better,\" Charlotte, who is now a mum of three, says. \"You just have to be here to see it.\" Charlotte says that it is often too difficult for people who are struggling to \"reach out\" and ask for help, so suggests people around them \"reach in\" instead. She continues to receive ongoing support for her mental health. She believes asking someone if they are OK more than once can help them open up. \"We owe it to each other to be checking in with people around us,\" she says. \"You don't have to offer life-changing advice or say anything profound. Just sitting down with a cuppa can make all the difference. \"Because of what I’ve been through, I had a duty to talk about it and I’m hoping it’s going to be a conversation starter.\" Listen to highlights fromWest Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latestepisode of Look Northor tell us a story you thinkwe should be covering here.",

        "headline": "Photos of Diana and William visiting homeless seen for first time",
        "text": "The Prince of Wales says “inspiration and guidance” from his mother, Diana, has been a driving force behind his personal commitment to tackle homelessness. In a forthcoming ITV documentary, Prince William talks about the profound impact of visits he made to The Passage homelessness shelter with his mother when he was a child - and how it helped him see “outside the palace walls”. The prince admits he sometimes feels guilty about not being able to do more - and wants to share with his own children a sense of empathy for those facing hardship. “When I was very small, my mother started talking about homelessness, much like I do now with my children on the school run,” says the prince. If passion projects reveal something about what drives someone, then perhaps his support forThe Passagecharity is key to unlocking Prince William’s character. The Westminster-based charity provides assistance and friendship for London’s homeless and helps them into secure accommodation. Forged by childhood memories of visits with his mother, the prince's longtime support for the charity has provided the foundation for his currentHomewardsproject, set up to tackle homelessness across the UK. “My mother took me to The Passage. She took Harry and I both there. I must have been about 11, I think, probably, at the time. Maybe 10. I’d never been to anything like that before. And I was a bit anxious as to what to expect,” he says in the ITV documentary, Prince William: We Can End Homelessness. “My mother went about her usual part of making everyone feel relaxed, and having a laugh and joking with everyone. \"I remember at the time, kind of thinking, well, if everyone’s not got a home, they’re all going to be really sad. “But it was incredible how happy an environment it was,” recalls Prince William. The Passage has revealed four previously unseen photos of the prince visiting their London base with his mother, the princess, in June and December 1993. “I remember having some good conversations - just playing chess and chatting,\" says the prince, of his childhood visits to The Passage. \"That’s when it dawned on me that there are other people out there who don’t have the same life as you do.\" Prince William became the charity's official patron in 2019, but those visits have continued both publicly and privately throughout his life, often for hours longer than scheduled. In the ITV documentary, the prince is filmed serving food and clearing up at The Passage’s Christmas dinner, hugging some of the regular visitors there. He is even seen being bossed around by the charity’s head chef, Claudette Dawkins, as she organises her royal helper. He speaks about his concern for some of the homeless he encounters \"who are in really bad place... It's like you want to just protect them\". Over the years, the prince says he has spent a lot of time gathering information about homelessness - now he wants to do something practical to prevent it. The prince addresses the question of his own privileged status - and argues that the point of having such a big public platform is to put it to good use, by taking action on issues such as reducing homelessness. “I feel, with my position and my platform, I should be delivering change,” he says. “I've spent enough time learning and listening to what people have been through that I feel almost guilty every time I leave that I'm not doing more to help. “I feel compelled to act, because I don't want to just talk about it. I don't want to just listen. I actually want to see someone smile because their life has been made better,\" says the prince. “Building a project is the only way I can see, at the moment, to try and alleviate [the problem], and help people who are in a much less fortunate, or in a very difficult, situation.” Mick Clarke, chief executive of The Passage, says of Prince William's visits: \"I think he feels most at home when he's just chatting away with our clients and hearing their stories. \"People can get very nervous, but he’s very good at putting people at ease.\" Prince William's Homewards project, which has six flagship locations across the UK, aims to show homelessness is not inevitable. \"The ultimate ambition is to prove that we can prevent homelessness in these regions, so then others will come along and go, well, if they can do it, why can’t we?\" says the prince. It draws on the experience of Finland, where homelessness was effectively reduced by a policy of providing secure accommodation for people, with wrap-around support for contributory issues such as mental health problems and addiction. Among those William speaks to over the course of the film is Sabrina Cohen-Hatton, who went from being arough sleeper to becoming a chief fire officer. She has used her own lived experience to advise the prince's current project. Lord John Bird, the forthright founder of the Big Issue, has warned of decades of failed initiatives to tackle homelessness, but has nonetheless backed the prince's intervention. \"I am very impressed that a young man who has got young children and could go and live the life of Riley, has decided to make a stand for the work that he wants to do, and the work that his mother did. \"Princess Diana was probably the only personality who shone a light on homelessness. \"What she was saying is, these are human beings and I’m going to address myself to it. And I think that her son, William, has said, this is the legacy.\" Prince William: We Can End Homelessness, ITV1, 30 and 31 October, 21.00.",

        "headline": "The hybrid workers in France seeking fulfilment in the fields",
        "text": "Desperate for a break from office drudgery but scared of not making ends meet?  France has an idea that might interest you: part-time farming. A new tribe has been identified that wants the best of both worlds: city and country;  laptop and the land;  the digital and the manual. These young mould-breakers use the opportunities of technology and workplace flexibility for a hybrid lifestyle that – they say – fits today’s desire for meaning as well as money. Working the soil brings the rewards of physical labour, and a sense of purpose too often missing from their spreadsheets and tabulations. But by edging in gently to farming, they keep the financial assurance of a back-up city salary, as well as the intellectual sustenance of their urban social circle. “In the corporate world, there are more and more people questioning the meaning of what they are doing. There’s an awful lot of burn-out and anxiety,” says Julien Maudet, data-engineer and cider-maker. “On the farm, you don’t have to ask. It’s obvious why you’re doing it. It’s to produce food for people. But you’re doing it in conditions that are often very uncertain and risky. “These two worlds - the farm and the office - are in crisis. And it dawned on me that each is the solution to the other.  What we need to do is bring the two worlds together.” Maudet is one of the founders of Slasheurs-cueilleurs, an organisation that seeks to promote these new cross-over careers. The name is a wordplay in French, because it sounds like the expression chasseurs-cueilleurs (hunter-gatherers). The slasheur part comes from the slash key on a computer, and denotes someone with more than one job (as in “I’m a chef-slash-football coach). The idea came to Maudet during the Covid lockdowns, when he went to ground at his grandparents’ farm in Normandy. When he began looking a year ago, he realised that there were already hundreds of people doing what he was advocating. “We invented nothing. We just shone a light,” he says. A classic example is Matthew Charlton, an English-born teacher at Sorbonne university who now spends more than half his week growing watercress in a smallholding 64km (40 miles) south of Paris. This part of the Essonne department was once famous for its “green gold”, but many cressonnières were abandoned from the 1970s and are only now being resurrected. “The beauty of watercress is that you don’t need machinery or massive investment. It’s just you and a pair of gumboots and a knife,” says Charlton, who harvests around 30,000 bunches every year for sale to farm shops and restaurants in Paris. “Today I am at the university on Mondays and Thursdays. The other days I am here at the farm or else delivering the cress in Paris – which is where I live. “It’s a lifestyle that suits me perfectly.  I get a lot of outdoors, then I can recharge my batteries two days a week in Paris. Eventually I want to do the cress full time, but this way I’ve been able to ease my way in, without taking on too much of a financial gamble.” Some of those who have become slasheurs have inherited family land; others rent it, or buy it, or have arrangements with farmers to pool resources.  Some live in the country for a couple of days a week; some make a reverse commute to fields in the city hinterland; some work seasonally. In the city they are lawyers, engineers and consultants. In the country they are market-gardeners, winegrowers or labourers. Only a few work with livestock, which demands a more permanent presence. What seems to unite them is a yearning for spiritual fulfilment, as well as an attachment to the idea of cleaner, organic production. All agree that office-based careers have left them at times feeling redundant and pointless. Marie Paitier, a cider-maker and human resources consultant, says she and her husband both suffered \"burn out” – by which she means emotional breakdowns – because of their city jobs. “It wasn’t just my employer’s fault. It was me,” she says. “I was working too hard. But now I share my time between Normandy, where we live and the children go to school, and Paris where I work part-time. “I didn’t want to leave everything behind. I liked my job in Paris – and the money is important. But this way we have the right balance.” City types have always dreamed of a simpler rural life, and there have been previous waves of emigration to the country –notably in the post-May ‘68 generation.  What is different now are the possibilities opened up by technology - remote working, artificial intelligence, flexible careers - as well as the growing importance of ecology as a factor in the choices we make. “This isn’t about rich people from the city playing at being farmers,” says Maudet. “Our vision is that this will be part of a fundamental change. “Our farms need more hands if they’re to produce the kind of quality food which we should be eating.  If we don’t get people into the fields, then farms will get bigger and bigger and more and more industrial. “And office workers, under threat from A.I., are looking for new outlets. We would be so much more resilient as a society, if we all went in to something more hybrid.”",

        "headline": "Pixies: 'The more you try to recapture youth, the sillier it sounds'",
        "text": "Pixies frontman Black Francis wouldn't be your first pick to read the CBeebies Bedtime Story. Over the course of his band's wildly influential career, his fractured, often abstract songs have referenced Biblical violence, mutilation, incest, torture and death. \"Sliced up eyeballs\" and \"goats of lust\" aren't traditionally the sort of images that help your toddler drift off to sleep. Luckily, he didn't recite his own lyrics when he popped into CBeebies earlier this month. The book he chose did have a distinct Pixies flavour, though. It's called There Was A Young Zombie Who Swallowed A Worm \"I usually don't do things like that, but I enjoyed it,\" the 59-year-old says. \"My girlfriend sort of insisted, so I did it with feeling and, you know, I raised five kids, so I'm pretty good at bedtime stories.\" It's hard to imagine Pixies appearing on children's television at any other point in their career. The abrasive riffs and intertwining harmonies of songs like Debaser, Monkey Gone To Heaven, and Where Is My Mind signposted the future of alternative rock in the late 1980s; and they were cited as inspirations by everyone from Nirvana and Radiohead to... er, James Blunt. (\"They'd be furious to hear that, wouldn't they?\" he recently said). Just as the artists they inspired began to hit the mainstream, the band broke up - but their reputation grew in their absence. In 2003, the NME named their 1989 album Doolittle (recorded for $40,000 in the basement of a hair salon) the second-best record of all time. Twelve years later, it sold its 300,000th copy in the UK, gaining the band their first ever platinum record, 30 years after they formed. By that point, they'd reunited for a first-rate second phase. When we speak, they're about to set off on an Australian stadium tour with Pearl Jam. \"Our audience just seems to get bigger all the time,\" Francis says... Hence the cameo on CBeebies. Pixies formed in 1986, when Francis (born Charles Thompson IV) dropped out of university and persuaded his guitarist room-mate Joey Santiago to do the same. A local newspaper ad brought in bassist Kim Deal and, through her, drummer Dave Lovering. A buzzy demo tape won them a contract with British label 4AD, and they were quickly embraced by the indie music press, where one writer described their corrosive sound as \"a wild new shock\". But the secret to their success, Francis says, is simplicity. He describes the first time Pixies headlined Reading festival in 1990. Further down the bill was a group whose show was a \"very Vegas kind of affair\". \"They had lights and confetti and balloons,\" he recalls. \"A lot of schtick going on. \"Their tour manager turned to our manager, Chas Banks, and said, 'So what do you have prepared for your set?\" \"And he replied, '25 good songs'\". \"I was very proud that that's how he responded, because that is literally all we had. We had no dance moves, we had no balloons, we literally just had our music. There's a tussle in the music, too, which vacillates between blood-curdling punk and what the band called \"dust-bowl songs\" - country-tinged, heartland folk ballads. Lovering has said the album is \"more traditional\" than earlier Pixies records. Francis says those seeds were sown in his 1990s solo work. \"I'm going to go out on a limb here, and I'll say something that I've not said in an interview before,\" he says. \"When the Pixies broke up, I began to allow myself to stand outside of so-called underground music. I even went and made a couple of records at Nashville. \"And when we got back together, there was a lot of reticence from the producers and, quietly, behind-the-scenes, the managers, who were trying to make sure that Charles didn't turn it into some sort of 'country thing'. \"I think I deferred to that somewhat, but I didn't feel like the results were necessarily notable. So I started to allow more of that stuff into the mix. \"And I think everyone around me has, consciously or unconsciously, relaxed and allowed me to do it.\" He warms to the theme, saying it's unreasonable to expect a band in their fifth decade to re-capture the spittle-flecked anger of youth. \"It gets harder to do those kind of things, because when you're young, there's so much naïvete driving the bus. Even if the song compositionally is flimsy, you make up for it with all that energy. \"But what happens is you get better at playing guitar, better at composing, and that naïve energy is gone. It's very hard to tap into it. It's much easier to tap into the I-know-what-the-hell-I'm-doing energy. \"And maybe that's not what people want to hear but, you know what? I can't be 19 years old again. And the harder you try, the sillier it sounds.\" One of his new songs disproves that theory. Oyster Beds is two minutes of lean, vigorous riffs coupled with what, on the surface, appear to be some of Francis's most surreal lyrics to date: \"A musketeer and her two deers / A country house in Dadasphere.\" In fact, he wrote the song in his art studio, and the lyrics are \"a little laundry list of things I've painted in the last few years\". \"I was kind of like, 'I just need some words here', and it's a punky song, so I wasn't feeling strongly about the message. What does he get from painting that music doesn't provide? \"Solace [from] other people,\" he laughs. \"Not that playing with people is bad, because it gives you companionship, but sometimes it can get laborious. \"With painting, I realised, 'Oh, I can do this and have all of the debates and fights in my head, and there's no one to answer to'.\" He proceeds to describe that process at entertaining length. \"So if the brushes are driving the bus, I'll be like, 'Don't forget about your narrative'. But then my inner monologue will go, 'Screw the narrative, because right now big brush is in charge and big brush is making a big mess'. \"Then it'll be like, 'Alright, you've ruined the painting enough, it's time to think about what this painting is about. We've got to let figurative take over for a while to bring some order to all this chaos'. \"And so it becomes this argument between the different elements of the painting. They're all professors at the Black Francis art school, and I really enjoy that. \"It's crazy, even insane, what's going on in my head, but I do it for hours.\" Crazy, maybe, but the most compelling art comes from creative chaos - and that's why, after all these years, Pixies are still a thrill.",
